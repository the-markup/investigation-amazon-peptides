# How We Investigated Injectable Peptides for Sale on Amazon.com
This repository contains data related to our story, '[Labeled “Research” Chemicals, Doping Drugs Sold Openly on Amazon.com](https://themarkup.org/banned-bounty/2020/09/17/amazon-sales-peptides-doping-drugs)'.

The data for our findings can be found in the data folder.

## data

This folder contains the data we created in reporting our story.

Our findings consist of a spreadsheet of the peptide listings that we found, and a collection of timestamped screenshots for the listing pages. Links to the individual screenshots are in the spreadsheet. The screenshots of all of the peptide listings we found are included in their entirety so that you can see the listings as they appeared to us in our reporting. 

_Note: A listing can have multiple offers from different sellers. Our data contains 82 offers and 66 listings (unique ASINs), so some listings appear multiple times but from different sellers._
